This repository contains projects for a course on Jagiellonian University.

## Project 1 - embeddings on a small dataset
The task was to produce the best embeddings we could on a small dataset containing tweets about airline companies and then evaluate embeddings on a simple logistic regression sentiment task for sentiment prediction. It's worth noting that the student's task was an unsupervised one - the labels for sentiment prediction were used only for evaluation of our model, no labels were used while training.

I've tested a few models:
* A simple basline
* Skip-gram without negative sampling
* Skip-gram with negative sampling
* CBOW with negative sampling
* CBOW for whole sentences

## Project 2 - flagging predictions
To be added.
